Knight\: Your Highness… you’re safe now.
Princess\: Safe? (looks around) I thought safety was just a dream by now.
Knight\: Dreams can be real… when someone refuses to give up on them.
Princess\: (softly) You came for me… even when everyone else turned away.
Knight\: A vow once made is not so easily broken.
Princess\: (smiles faintly) Then let me make one too — I will not hide behind walls again.
Knight\: Then let’s ride, my lady. There’s still a kingdom waiting to be free.
