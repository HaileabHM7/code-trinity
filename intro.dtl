The moon is high ... She doesnt have much time
This Shadow creatures ... they're drawn to her light.
Every minute that passes the curse tights its grip.
My sword feels heavier with each swing.
What parts of my self must i sacrifice to reach her.
No matter the cost, i will save her before the mid-night.
